The rapid advancements in Warp Drive technology have made these vessels obsolete for anything besides system defense roles, as they are simply incapable of the operational range necessary for deep space assignments. Despite the success of Enterprise and its sister ships, NX Class vessels are prohibitively expensive to construct. For each NX Class ship, two Intrepid or three Neptune / Ganges ships could be constructed, or twice as many retrofitted. As the construction of NX Class vessels is in any event limited due to the lack of suitable construction facilities, the United Earth Council has directed Starfleet to begin retrofitting the existing fleet. Description Applying lessons learnt from the Warp Five Program, the engineers at the Luna Fleet Yards were able to retrofit the Warp Three engine design to achieve a maximum sustainable speed of Warp 4.5, more than tripling the maximum operational speed. The refit involves the addition of a secondary reaction chamber and a complete rebuild of the field coils following the design used in Warp 5 vessels. Main engineering must be expanded to accommodate the new design, often at the expense of cargo and crew capacity. For Intrepid class vessels, the retrofit adds a second level to main engineering, similar to that found in NX vessels.

Commander T'Lek [Imprisoned] Mission Role : Survey Ship Destroyed June 2156 Location : Galorndon Core Description The SS Nightingale was one of the last Neptune Class vessels to leave the United Earth Luna Fleet Yards before construction shifted to the newly constructed shipyards at Utopia Planitia. Under the charter of the United Earth Space Probe Agency , the Nightingale undertook three successful Five Year Missions to charter the local star cluster surrounding the Sol System. In 2154, at the completion of it's third Five Year Mission, the Nightingale underwent an major refit at the Luna Ship Yards, where the ship's warp drive was retrofitted with an experimental Warp 4.5 Engine. If successful, the design can be easily adapted to the rest of the aging Ganges and Neptune fleet, extending their lifespan and significantly increasing Starfleet's effective reach. In 2156, the Nightingale conducted a routine survey of the systems bordering Romulan space. A navigational error caused the ship to veer into the Galorndon System. As the ship dropped out of warp to ascertain its bearing, a Romulan Bird of Prey decloaked and opened fire. Unlike previous encounters of the sort, the Romulan commander allowed the ship to surrender peacefully and report their status to Starfleet. With the Endeavour dispatched to render assistance to the crippled Nightingale , the injured crew was evacuated while full terms were negotiated with the Romulan commander. An investigation of the ship's computers revealed that the Science Officer, Lt. Commander T'Lek, had reprogrammed the navigational array to feed false data into the ship's course controller. The reasons for this this action are unknown. Although the surviving crew was successfully evacuated, the Nightingale* itself was lost after negotiations broke down. Notable Events 2154, September : The Nightingale undergoes an experimental refit to increase its maximum speed to Warp 4.5. 2156, June : SS Nightingale veers off-course into disputed space and comes under attack by Romulan Bird-of-Prey T'Varen . The vessel is lost after an unprovoked escalation by the Romulan ship, but not before the Endeavour rescues the surviving crew.

Starfleet Command was founded in 2135 in response to the growing need for a centralized space command body to represent United Earth within the interstellar community. Although primarily intended as a civilian service organization, Starfleet was modelled after the various national armed forces of the Post-Atomic Horror, including the use of naval military ranks and a strict hierarchy. These national forces naturally provided an initial seed of desperately needed skilled personnel, as the ratification of the United Earth Charter practically obsoleted the need for their existence. Though the move drew condemnation from several members of the United Earth Council and the few remaining holdout nations, the charter was nevertheless ratified without amendment. Established by charter under UESPA , Starfleet Command is solely responsible for UEG's manned space craft fleet.
