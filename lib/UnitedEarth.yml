History :
  Description : >-
    In the rubble of the Post-Atomic Horror, Earth's fractured governments had abolished any concept of a unified world
    government. With the arrival of the Vulcans came a increasing tensions, as the various nations of Earth accused
    one another of conspiring with the aliens while simultaneously attempting to negotiate unilaterally with the
    Vulcans to gain the upper hand.


    From the Vulcan perspective, this situation was untenable. An agreement with any one nation threatened to plunge
    the world back into war, and in any event the Vulcan High Command had no intentions of renegotiating the same terms
    repeatedly. The High Command sent an ultimatum: speak with one voice or forever remain silent. It took nearly
    five years, but in 2068 the Interstellar Commerce Act formally established the Trade Council for Earth to represent
    Earth in negotiations with the Vulcans.


    The success of the Trade Council and the unprecedented prosperity ushered a new Golden Era for Earth in the early
    22nd Century. Spurred by a renewed sense of hope and under pressure from the Vulcan Embassy, the nations of Earth
    began negotiations to create a fourth iteration of the United Nations. The representative from the European
    Hegemony, keeping in mind the failure of the New United Nations to prevent WWIII, proposed a radical departure
    from previous proposals. Rather than acting primarily as an advisory body, the United Earth Charter was modeled
    as a constitutional federal system, with a strong unicameral United Earth Council as the premier legislative body.


    The Charter was initially controversial, and many nations refused to sign it. Matthew Root, the Hegemony
    representative, had foreseen such a result, and had prevented any language requiring unanimous approval from
    being inserted into the document. With the backing of the European Hegemony, the Pan-African Alliance, and the
    United States, the Charter came into effect in 2113. The Vulcan Embassy accepted the United Earth Government as
    the official representative body, with the caveat that the holdout states continue to receive a fair share of the
    technological and economic benefits of interstellar trade. Despite this, the holdout states quickly found themselves
    marginalized and excluded from interstellar negotiations, and by 2150 all nations had signed the Charter.
