Description : >-
  Humanity's sixth Warp 5 capable ship, the *Endeavour* was constructed at the Warp Five
  Complex in Bozeman, Montana. The *Endeavour* received several enhancements to the
  original NX Class specification as part of the standard construction, including Phase
  Cannons and Photonic Torpedo Launchers.


  Under charter from UESPA, *Endeavour* is assigned a Five Year Mission along the
  Narendra Sector, partially as a response to increasing Romulan aggression in the
  area. Until such a time as Admiral Douglas' fleet modernization project is complete,
  the *Endeavour* remains Starfleet's sole emergency responder in the region.
