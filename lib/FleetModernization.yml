      The Fleet Modernization Program, launched in 2152, is the initiative to extend the
      service lifespan of the *Ganges*, *Intrepid*, and Neptune* class ships that make up
      the bulk of the fleet. The rapid advancements in Warp Drive technology have made
      these vessels obsolete for anything besides system defense roles, as they are simply
      incapable of the operational range necessary for deep space assignments.


      Despite the success of *Enterprise* and its sister ships, *NX Class* vessels are
      prohibitively expensive to construct. For each *NX Class* ship, two *Intrepid* or
      three *Neptune*/*Ganges* ships could be constructed, or twice as many retrofitted. As
      the construction of *NX Class* vessels is in any event limited due to the lack of
      suitable construction facilities, the United Earth Council has directed Starfleet to
      begin retrofitting the existing fleet.

      Applying lessons learnt from the Warp Five Program, the engineers at the Luna Fleet
      Yards were able to retrofit the Warp Three engine design to achieve a maximum
      sustainable speed of Warp 4.5, more than tripling the maximum operational speed.


      The refit involves the addition of a secondary reaction chamber and a complete
      rebuild of the field coils following the design used in Warp 5 vessels. Main
      engineering must be expanded to accommodate the new design, often at the expense of
      cargo and crew capacity. For *Intrepid* class vessels, the retrofit adds a second
      level to main engineering, similar to that found in *NX* vessels.


      The *SS Nightingale* was used as a testbed for the refit design, and subsequently
      deployed to the Narendra Sector for a deep space survey mission.
