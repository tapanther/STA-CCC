  Description : >-
    The Space Agency is responsible for managing Vulcan's interstellar fleet, akin to United Earth's Starfleet.
    The VSA had previously been placed under the jurisdiction of the High Command, but has since been restored to
    an independent agency.


    The Space Agency is currently suffering a severe manpower crisis, as Minister T'Pau's efforts to clear house
    have dragged on due to resistance from supporters of former Administrator V'Las. With much of the Vulcan government
    paralyzed by procedural considerations, the Space Agency has had no choice but to mothball most of the Vulcan fleet.
