Description : >-
  The *SS Nightingale* was one of the last Neptune Class vessels to leave the United
  Earth Luna Fleet Yards before construction shifted to the newly constructed shipyards
  at Utopia Planitia.


  Under the charter of the United Earth Space Probe Agency, the *Nightingale* undertook
  three successful Five Year Missions to charter the local star cluster surrounding the
  Sol System.


  In 2154, at the completion of it's third Five Year Mission, the *Nightingale* underwent
  an major refit at the Luna Ship Yards, where the ship's warp drive was retrofitted with
  an experimental Warp 4.5 Engine. If successful, the design can be easily adapted to the
  rest of the aging Ganges and Neptune fleet, extending their lifespan and significantly
  increasing Starfleet's effective reach.


  In 2156, the *Nightingale* conducted a routine survey of the systems bordering Romulan
  space. A navigational error caused the ship to veer into the Galorndon System. As the
  ship dropped out of warp to ascertain its bearing, a Romulan Bird of Prey decloaked and
  opened fire. Unlike previous encounters of the sort, the Romulan commander allowed the
  ship to surrender peacefully and report their status to Starfleet.


  With the *Endeavour* dispatched to render assistance to the crippled *Nightingale*, the
  injured crew was evacuated while full terms were negotiated with the Romulan commander.
  An investigation of the ship's computers revealed that the Science Officer, Lt.
  Commander T'Lek, had reprogrammed the navigational array to feed false data into the
  ship's course controller. The reasons for this this action are unknown. Although the
  surviving crew was successfully evacuated, the Nightingale* itself was lost after
  negotiations broke down.
