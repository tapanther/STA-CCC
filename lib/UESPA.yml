  Description : >-
    Founded in 2060, the United Earth Space Probe Agency is the United Earth Government
    agency tasked with peaceful exploration of space. UESPA predates Starfleet Command,
    and officially considers itself as the descendant organization to the United Nations
    Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA), which disbanded in 2053 along with its parent
    organization.


    UESPA does not directly own or operate manned craft, as it is primarily a scientific
    and administrative body. Instead, the construction of manned spacecraft, from the
    initial *Warp-Alpha* to the latest *NX* class ship, *Endevour*, are joint ventures
    between Starfleet and the United Earth Space Probe Agency. Starfleet vessels are
    granted exploration charters under the authority of UESPA, typically in the form of
    Five Year Missions.


    UESPA does construct and operate unmanned probes, though the NX-Program has
    temporarily consumed all of UESPA's resources. Unmanned operations are scheduled to
    resume by 2162, after the completion of the planned 12 *NX* class ships.
