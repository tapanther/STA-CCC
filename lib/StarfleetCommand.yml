    Starfleet Command is the mixed service responsible for starship operations for the
    United Earth Government. Starfleet Command was founded in 2135 in response to the
    growing need for a centralized space command body to represent United Earth within the
    interstellar community.


    Although primarily intended as a civilian service organization, Starfleet was modelled
    after the various national armed forces of the Post-Atomic Horror, including the use
    of naval military ranks and a strict hierarchy. These national forces naturally
    provided an initial seed of desperately needed skilled personnel, as the ratification
    of the United Earth Charter practically obsoleted the need for their existence. Though
    the move drew condemnation from several members of the United Earth Council and the
    few remaining *holdout* nations, the charter was nevertheless ratified without
    amendment.


    Established by charter under UESPA, Starfleet Command is solely responsible for UEG's
    manned space craft fleet. Private space craft, including the various interstellar
    freighters, are separately licensed and managed by the United Earth Trade Council,
    while unmanned probes are operated directly by UESPA. Starfleet vessels are granted
    exploration charters, typically in the form of Five Year Missions, under the
    authority of UESPA. While the charter sets a general mandate for a starship's mission,
    day to day operations are entirely within the purview of Starfleet Command.


    Starfleet was pressed into full military service following the Xindi attack on earth
    in 2153, and the founding charter was quickly amended during an emergency session of
    the United Earth Council to include a mandate for planetary defense of Earth and its
    Colonies. The same session ratified the charter for the creation of the Military
    Assault Command Operations (MACO) as an independent armed forces for UEG.
