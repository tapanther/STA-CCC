    Little is known about the governmental structure of the Empire. No formal relations
    exist between Coalition members and the Empire, despite multiple attempts to
    communicate via subspace. Given the known technological capabilities of Romulan
    vessels, it is unlikely that the Empire lacks the capability to respond, leaving
    only the conclusion that they have chosen to remain silent.
