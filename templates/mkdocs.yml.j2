    Welcome to the STA:CCC Player's Wiki!


    This site contains canon, in-universe information for the game. The information on this site takes precedence over
    [Memory Alpha](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/) or [Memory Beta](https://memory-beta.fandom.com/).


    Some pages may contain only links to these sites, in which case there is no game-specific information at this time.
    Others may not have either link, in which case the information on those sites should be considered non-canon for
    the purposes of the game.


    The entirety of `Star Trek: Enterprise` is considered canon, but information from future series should not be
    taken as fully canon, as the older series often have contradictory information about this time period of human
    history.
